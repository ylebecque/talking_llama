What Is Ollama?
Ollama provides a simple API for creating, running, and managing language models. It also offers a library of pre-built models that can be easily integrated into your applications. Letâ€™s get started!
Use Cases: 
The simple answer is YES and I will tell you why I believe that. Some of the use cases I have been using it for are mentioned below:
Solving your Coding Doubts: For simple coding doubts and syntax asks, simply fire this up with 1 line of code and you are good, no need to run to google each time.
Fueling your Curiosity: You can use this to ask your basic curiosity questions that you have. For example, when I code I have random doubts like how does str module work behind the scenes or how what is the time complexity of a function, so this comes very handy at that time.
Unleashing the power of all models locally without much hassle: As a AI Developer and a Content Creator, I keep a track of all the new model releases and their performances and this module helps me in that.
